# Statistical Algorithms Implemented

This repository implements a variety of statistical algorithms using **C++**, **R**, and **Python**, showcasing the strengths of each language. While **C++** excels in performance and efficiency, **R** is well-known for its comprehensive statistical libraries, and **Python** is widely appreciated for its ease of use, flexibility, and rich ecosystem.

## Algorithms Overview

### 1. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - **Purpose**: Provides summary metrics that describe the main characteristics of a dataset.
   - **Common Algorithms**:
     - Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode
     - Measures of Spread: Variance, Standard Deviation
     - Distribution Metrics: Skewness, Kurtosis
   - **C++ Example**:  
     C++ provides efficient computation of descriptive statistics using the Standard Template Library (STL). For instance, `std::accumulate` can be used for sums and means, and `std::sort` for calculating medians.

     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     #include <vector>
     #include <numeric>
     #include <algorithm>

     double compute_mean(const std::vector<double>& data) {
         return std::accumulate(data.begin(), data.end(), 0.0) / data.size();
     }

     double compute_median(std::vector<double> data) {
         std::sort(data.begin(), data.end());
         size_t n = data.size();
         if (n % 2 == 0) {
             return (data[n / 2 - 1] + data[n / 2]) / 2;
         } else {
             return data[n / 2];
         }
     }
     ```

### 2. **Regression Analysis**
   - **Purpose**: Models relationships between dependent and independent variables.
   - **Common Algorithms**:
     - Linear Regression (OLS)
     - Logistic Regression
     - Ridge and Lasso Regression
   - **C++ Example**:  
     Implementing regression analysis in C++ can be optimized for performance, especially when handling large datasets. The STL and libraries like `Eigen` allow efficient matrix operations for regression analysis.

     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     #include <vector>
     #include <numeric>

     double linear_regression_slope(const std::vector<double>& x, const std::vector<double>& y) {
         double mean_x = compute_mean(x);
         double mean_y = compute_mean(y);

         double numerator = std::inner_product(x.begin(), x.end(), y.begin(), 0.0) - x.size() * mean_x * mean_y;
         double denominator = std::inner_product(x.begin(), x.end(), x.begin(), 0.0) - x.size() * mean_x * mean_x;

         return numerator / denominator;
     }
     ```

### 3. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - **Purpose**: Tests assumptions about population parameters using statistical evidence.
   - **Common Algorithms**:
     - t-Test (One-sample, Two-sample)
     - Chi-squared Test
     - ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
   - **C++ Example**:  
     Hypothesis tests, like the t-test, can be efficiently implemented in C++ using tools from the STL for array manipulation and numerical computations.

     ```cpp
     #include <vector>
     #include <numeric>
     #include <cmath>   

     double compute_standard_deviation(const std::vector<double>& data, double mean) {
         double sum = std::accumulate(data.begin(), data.end(), 0.0, 
             [mean](double acc, double x) { return acc + (x - mean) * (x - mean); });
         return std::sqrt(sum / (data.size() - 1));
     }

     double t_statistic(const std::vector<double>& data, double population_mean) {
         double sample_mean = compute_mean(data);
         double std_dev = compute_standard_deviation(data, sample_mean);
         return (sample_mean - population_mean) / (std_dev / std::sqrt(data.size()));
     }
     ```

### 4. **Bayesian Inference**
   - **Purpose**: A probabilistic approach to model parameters using Bayes' Theorem.
   - **Common Algorithms**:
     - Bayesian Linear Regression
     - Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
     - Gibbs Sampling
   - **C++ Example**:  
     C++ is well-suited for implementing complex iterative algorithms like MCMC, using its efficient memory management and data structures (`std::vector`, `std::array`) to store chains and update posterior estimates.

### 5. **Clustering**
   - **Purpose**: Group similar data points into clusters for unsupervised learning.
   - **Common Algorithms**:
     - K-Means Clustering
     - Hierarchical Clustering
     - Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
   - **C++ Example**:  
     Clustering algorithms like K-Means can be optimized for performance in C++, especially for large datasets. The `std::vector` container can be used to store data points, and `std::transform` to efficiently update centroids.

     ```cpp
     #include <vector>
     #include <algorithm>

     void update_centroid(std::vector<double>& centroid, const std::vector<std::vector<double>>& cluster) {
         std::transform(centroid.begin(), centroid.end(), cluster.begin(), centroid.begin(), 
             [](double& c, const std::vector<double>& point) {
                 return c + std::accumulate(point.begin(), point.end(), 0.0) / cluster.size();
             });
     }
     ```

## Integrating C++, R, and Python

While each language has its strengths, integrating **C++**, **R**, and **Python** can leverage the best of all worlds. C++ can be used for performance-critical components, such as computationally intensive algorithms or large-scale data processing. Python, with its simple syntax and rich ecosystem (e.g., libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy), can act as the glue that connects the entire workflow, facilitating fast prototyping and easy integration with various tools. Finally, R can be employed for specialized statistical analysis, taking advantage of its deep statistical libraries and visualization capabilities.

Through tools like **Rcpp** (to connect C++ with R) and **pybind11** or **SWIG** (to interface C++ with Python), we can seamlessly blend these languages into a cohesive pipeline. This allows for efficient use of C++ where performance matters, while still benefiting from the flexibility and ease of use provided by R and Python.

## Why Use C++ for Statistical Computing?

### Why use C++?

C++ is an excellent choice for statistical computing due to several advantages:

1. **Performance**: C++ is a compiled language, offering faster execution times compared to interpreted languages like Python and R. This makes it ideal for handling large-scale datasets and computationally intensive algorithms such as MCMC, Bayesian inference, and clustering.
   
2. **Fine-Grained Memory Control**: C++ provides direct control over memory management, allowing for optimizations when dealing with large or complex data structures. This is particularly useful in scenarios where memory efficiency is critical, such as in high-dimensional data analysis.

3. **STL and Numerical Libraries**: The Standard Template Library (STL) provides a powerful set of algorithms and data structures like `std::vector`, `std::accumulate`, and `std::transform`, which facilitate efficient statistical computations. Additionally, C++ integrates well with advanced numerical libraries like **Eigen** (for linear algebra) and **Boost** (for extended statistical functions), enabling high-performance implementations of complex algorithms.
